# Basic login project with Angular 6
This is a example of a login with Angular6. Well it's not only login, its actually authentication and it's basic pattern.

## Reinventing the wheel again
Every project I have authentication (web or mobile), I keep repeating myself and write the authentication layer from scratch. As I get older, I wanted to have a basic goto authentication template to work with. So that's the reason of this little sample project.

## What's in this project?
- Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Fontawesome 5 (https://fontawesome.com/)
- Angular 6 (https://angular.io/)
- A basisc authentication service to handle the login/logout/check authentication token
- A simple secure dashboard
- A simple login page (including error handling)
- A fake backend service to handle the api request
- A service to inject the authentication token on each request to the api
- Angular Routing system
- Some RxJS function (http://reactivex.io/) 

## The authentication pattern
So what's the authentication pattern/lifecycle?

- Login (validate the user on the serve)
- Check the auhtentication status of the logged in user
- Logout

Sounds easy right? But a lot goes into this logic. And a lot of this logic goes behind the scenes. Let's dive into it.

## Login flow
So for mortal people, they only see the login page, fill in the details and press submit. But what actually happens behind the screen? These are (in short) the steps/workflow:

- The application sends the login data to the server.
- Server checks if the user is valid.
- If the user is valid, the server will generate a token. This token is associated to the user, so every time a api request is made with that token, the server knows wich user it is.
- The server will return (or not) the token (and depending on your backend service also some basic information about the user)
- When the application recieves the token, the token will be locally stored and the user get's redirected to the next page (usually a home or dashboard page).
- If there is a invalid login, the application needs to handle the error (for example display an error text)

## Validate token flow
Each time you start the application, it checks if there was a token stored. The token is just a string generated by the server. This token can be anything ofcourse. So we need to check if the token is still valid. The basic flow is this:

- The application checks if a token is stored.
- If there's a token stored, check make a api request to validate the token.
- If everything in the the above steps is ok, then the application can just continue.
- If there was an error of any kind, the logout process is started and the user will be presented with the login screen

If you want, you coud also validate the token, each time a secured page is called by the application. Do keep in mind that this also requires new api requests to the server. For my example project, I've choosen to only validate when you start the application.

## Logout flow
When the logout process is started (started by the user or by the application), the following wil happen:

- An api request is made to the server with the stored token.
- The server can remove the token, so this token cannot be used anymore.
- The application will delete all stored data related to authentication (for example the token, user meta data).
- The application will send a signal that a logout is issued so other components/services etc can act on it.
- The user is redirected to the login page

## Angular specifics
So now we got the the basics covered. Let's see some Angular specific logic choices I made for :

- Login 
- Routing
- Logout
- Fake backend
- Token intercept

## Login
So I've made an authentication service to handle the login. Normally I would create a service function with a http request and subscribe to it. I think most Angular developers can relate to this. But in this example I've changed it a little bit (because I can). I came across this post about converting the subscribe to a promise with the help of the async-await feature : https://medium.com/@balramchavan/using-async-await-feature-in-angular-587dd56fdc77. The idea is to make the http request, but the result is then converted to a promise. The authors statement is that it's not logical to subscribe or stream when you only do the request once. The login part is a one time only. You don't login on each page. You only login again when you're logged out again. So I decided to give this method a go.

## Routing
For this example, I wanted to have a different layout for the login page (a public page) and a different layout for the secured pages. In order to do that I needed a system to tell the routing to use different router outlets. When you look at my routing file, you will see that the dashboard page (a secured page) is a child member of LayoutComponent. The LayoutComponent has the template layout for all secured pages. And as you can see, the login page is not a child member. 

Ofcourse there are other options to this. And maybe in the future I will change this system, just yeah because I can.

## Logout
I've setup the most top level logout in the app.component.ts. For me this is the logical place because it's the most top level component. Ofcourse other components can subscribe to the logout event to do some garbage collection.

## Fake backend
To acutally test the login/logout/validate token, I've setup a fake backend using the HttpInterceptor ( https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor). For those who don't know what this is, this a way to interecpt all incomming and outgoing requests and (if you want) alter the request. 

## Token intercept
So after a succesfull login, a token is generated by the server and the application will store the token locally in the browser. So now each api quest to the server must have the token to validate the user. The token in placed in the http headers (Autentication Bearer) on each request. So you could do this hard coded with each request, but this can also be automated. Using the HttpInterceptor again, we can actually listen when an api request is made to the server and then the token is automaticly added to the http headers.

Well that's it for now. You can find me on linkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/fransjoleihitu/.
